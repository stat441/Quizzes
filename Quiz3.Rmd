Propose an experiment and outline steps 1 - 5 below, for now consider just a single treatment factor. Note we will soon have our first project and while you do not have to do what you propose here, it will make the project easier.

1. Define objective
2. Define meaningful and measurable response
3. Diagram treatment application process for a single run
4. Identify experimental units
5. List sources of variation.
